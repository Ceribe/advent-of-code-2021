This was a surprisingly easy day. Part 1 required only a couple of simple loops and checks.
Part 2 was exactly as I suspected, the only difference was the number of minutes.
Luckly from even just looking at the example you could see that
the pattern would stabilize after some iterations. So I did the most obvious thing and just
run the same code, but increased number of iterations to 1000 and it worked.
