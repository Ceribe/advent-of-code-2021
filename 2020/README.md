# [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020)

Swift enforces a project structure so it is a bit different than in other years.
"src" directory is replaced with "Sources". Then instead of the usual "solution.sth" file
there is a "main.swift" file. Additionaly utils file is in an additional package.
