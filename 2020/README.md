# [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020)

This year's project structure is a bit different than other years, because I could not
figure out how to change it to the usual one without breaking everything (having a
grand total of 30min of Swift experience did not help). So "src" directory is replaced
with "Sources/2020". Then instead of the usual "solution.sth" file there is a "main.swift" file.

# How to run

After cloning open "2020" directory in VSCode. Then assuming you have Swift and Swift extension
installed the only thing you need to do is to open the wanted "main.swift" and run it (Ctrl + F5).
