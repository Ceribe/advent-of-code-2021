# [Advent of Code 2016](https://adventofcode.com/2016)

This year was harder than 2015, but still easier than 2021. 
I liked the fact that days 12, 23 and 25 used the same base (assembunny). If I knew about
that beforehand then I would write assembunny interpreter as a separate module instead of
copying and pasting it for each day. Maybe in the future I will extract it to not have 
duplicated code.

## The Hardest One

### [Day 11: Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators](https://github.com/ceribe/advent-of-code/tree/main/2016/11)

This day was definitely the hardest to find the solution, but after finding it, it does not seem that hard anymore.

Other notably difficult days:
- [Day 22: Grid Computing](https://github.com/ceribe/advent-of-code/tree/main/2016/22)
- [Day 23: Safe Cracking](https://github.com/ceribe/advent-of-code/tree/main/2016/23)

## The Most Tedious One

## The Most Fun One

# How to run

Since this is a standard GoLand project just launch it and run whichever "solution.go" you want.
