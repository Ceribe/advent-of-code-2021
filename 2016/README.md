This repository contains solutions for all 25 days of Advent of Code 2016. This year was
harder than 2015, but still easier than 2021. The hardest day was
definitely [11](https://github.com/ceribe/advent-of-code-2016/tree/master/11), 
but some later days ([22](https://github.com/ceribe/advent-of-code-2016/tree/master/22) 
and [23](https://github.com/ceribe/advent-of-code-2016/tree/master/23)) were also quite difficult.
I liked the fact that days 12, 23 and 25 used the same base (assembunny). If I knew about
that beforehand then I would write assembunny interpreter as a separate module instead of
copy pasting it for each day. Maybe in the future I will extract it to not have duplicated code.
