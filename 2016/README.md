# [Advent of Code 2016](https://adventofcode.com/2016)

This year was harder than 2015, but still easier than 2021. 
I liked the fact that days 12, 23 and 25 used the same base (assembunny). The overall difficulty level was just right. There was no stupidly complicated
day or one that took an insane number of hours complete.

## The Hardest One

### [Day 11: Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators](https://github.com/ceribe/advent-of-code/tree/main/2016/src/11)

This day was definitely the hardest to find the solution, but after finding it, it does not seem that hard anymore.

Other notably difficult days:
- [Day 22: Grid Computing](https://github.com/ceribe/advent-of-code/tree/main/2016/src/22)
- [Day 23: Safe Cracking](https://github.com/ceribe/advent-of-code/tree/main/2016/src/23)

## The Most Fun One

### [Day 24: Air Duct Spelunking](https://github.com/ceribe/advent-of-code/tree/main/2016/src/24)

# How to run

Since this is a standard GoLand project just launch it and run whichever "solution.go" you want.
