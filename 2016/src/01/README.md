# [Day 1: No Time for a Taxicab](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/1)

Considering this is Day 1, I was surprised with the difficulty, because 2021 and 2015
were significantly easier. This was also my first ever Go program, so I was kinda
confused why is there no set data structure or enums.

As for the solution I just parsed the input file as a slice of commands. Each command
would modify direction and position.
