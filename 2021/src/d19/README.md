# [Day 19: Beacon Scanner](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/19)

This was the hardest day from this year and quite possibly the hardest advent
of code day ever. The solution I made works, but that's about it. It is 
probably the worst piece of code I ever wrote. Look only if you absolutely 
have to and even then I don't recommend.
