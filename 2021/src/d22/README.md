# [Day 22: Reactor Reboot](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/22)

This was an amazing day. Fun to solve while still being hard. Part 1 could 
be rewritten to use the same mechanisms as part 2, but trying to combine them
would just make things unreadable. Coping the code was also not an option
because I don't like breaking DRY, so I decided to leave it the way it 
because it is fast enough.
