# [Day 23: Amphipod](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/23)

Similarly to Day 19 the only good thing about this solution is that it works.
It runs extremely slow, has a lot of duplicated code, and is very hard to read.
Some heavy refactoring would be needed, but at the moment I don't have that
kind of time.
