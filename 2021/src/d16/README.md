# [Day 16: Packet Decoder](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/16)

This day was not bad by itself, but the fact that none of the test cases
covered the problem which occurred when using the real input was infuriating.
In part 2 Integer would overflow, but since for the last 15 days
that was not the problem I did not think about it, and instead I tried to find
a different reason.
