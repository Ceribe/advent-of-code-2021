# [Day 18: Snailfish](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/18)

Surprisingly this day was not that hard. It was just a lot of code. I decided
to go with full OOP for this one. If I have chosen not to the amount of code
would probably be smaller. Additionally, I made some less than ideal chooses 
so the efficiency is not that great, but since the result is calculated in
under a second there was no need to make improvements.
