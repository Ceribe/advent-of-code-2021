# [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

This was my first Advent of Code. I decided to take part in it, because of
a JetBrains post I saw. I thought it would be fun, and I was not wrong, it was a lot of fun. 
More solutions than I would like to are bruteforce, but since they worked I didn't feel the need to change them.

## The Hardest One

### [Day 19: Beacon Scanner](https://github.com/ceribe/advent-of-code/tree/main/2021/src/d19)

Day 19 was by far the hardest one to finish and even after finishing it I'm afraid to touch it.
This year had multiple hard challenges, so I should also mention them:
- [Day 23: Amphipod](https://github.com/ceribe/advent-of-code/tree/main/2021/src/d23)
- [Day 24: Arithmetic Logic Unit](https://github.com/ceribe/advent-of-code/tree/main/2021/src/d24)
- [Day 22: Reactor Reboot](https://github.com/ceribe/advent-of-code/tree/main/2021/src/d22)

## The Most Tedious One

### [Day 23: Amphipod](https://github.com/ceribe/advent-of-code/tree/main/2021/src/d23)

The amount of code that had to be written to get an even half working solution was painful. On top of that finishing part 1
only to discover that all the code that I wrote is useless for part 2 and I have to heavily refactor everything was too much.
This was the only day when I had to take a break between parts.

## The Most Fun One

### [Day 22: Reactor Reboot](https://github.com/ceribe/advent-of-code/tree/main/2021/src/d22)

It was hard to choose the most fun one, because all the days were fun. Well... except for 23 and 16 (finding out that my 
code was not working, because I used Int instead of Long was the opposite of fun).

# How to run

Since this is a standard Intellij IDEA project just launch it and run whichever "Solution.kt" you want.
