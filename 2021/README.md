# [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

This was my first Advent of Code. I decided to take part, because
I saw a JetBrains post about it and I thought it would be fun.
I was not wrong, and it was a lot of fun. More solutions than I would like 
to are bruteforce, but since they worked I didn't feel the need to change them.
