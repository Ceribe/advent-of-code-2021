# [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

This was my first Advent of Code. I decided to take part in it, because of
a JetBrains post I saw. I thought it would be fun and I was not wrong, it was a lot of fun. 
More solutions than I would like to are bruteforce, but since they worked I didn't feel the need to change them.
