In this task I decided to parse each line of input file as an instance of Reindeer class
and then iteratively increase their distance travelled using a simple for loop. 
After that the only thing left was to extract max travelled distance.

For part 2 the only change required was to check the current max distance after each iteration
and give each reindeer with this distance one point.
