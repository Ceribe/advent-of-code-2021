Part one was weirdly simple to solve so I'll skip that. Part 2 required a few changes. I made the loop infinite and checked 
whether a buffor of 20 elements contained the desired number. If not the I moved the buffor's starting index by 10 and continued
looping until there was once again 20 elements from buffor's starting index.
