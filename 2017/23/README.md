Part 2 was amazing. Transpiling assembly to ruby by hand was extremely fun.
About halfway through I realised that the program has something to do with
prime numbers. After looking at "hand_compiled.rb" I realised that the program
is just counting the number of non-prime numbers in the range. Implementing a ruby
program which does that was trivial.
