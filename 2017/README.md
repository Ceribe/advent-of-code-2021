This repository contains solutions for all 25 days of Advent of Code 2017. This year was
slightly easier than 2016, but still a lot of fun. The most fun day was definitely
[23](https://github.com/ceribe/advent-of-code-2017/tree/master/23). I loved transpiling
assembler to ruby by hand. The most annoying day was [3](https://github.com/ceribe/advent-of-code-2017/tree/master/3).
It was not exactly hard, but was tedious and the code I wrote looks horrible. None of the days were exceptionally hard,
but if I had to pick one day, I would pick day 23 as it required the most time to finish. If day
[24](https://github.com/ceribe/advent-of-code-2017/tree/master/24) was not bruteforce-able (eg. 100 components instead of 57),
then I would pick it as I have no idea how to solve it effectively.
