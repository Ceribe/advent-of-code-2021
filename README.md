# Welcome to Advent of Code[^aoc]

This repository contains solutions for all 25 days of Advent of Code 2021. Some have comments, some don't. I was trying to be as fast as possible so readability wasn't a goal here. More solutions than I would like are bruteforce, but since they worked I didn't feel the need to change them.

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ an annual event in December since 2015.
    Every year since then, with the first day of December, a programming puzzles contest is published every day for twenty-four days.
    A set of Christmas-oriented challenges provide any input you have to use to answer using the language of your choice.
