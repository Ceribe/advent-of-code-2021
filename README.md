# Welcome to Advent of Code[^aoc]

This repository contains solutions for all 25 days of Advent of Code 2015.
This is my second year of Advent of Code (did 2021 before) and I have to say this one was
way easier. 20+ Days were easier than some 10- Days in 2021. This year I wrote way too many
bruteforce solutions and surprisingly most of them worked, so I had no real need to upgrade them.

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ an annual event in December since 2015.
    Every year since then, with the first day of December, a programming puzzles contest is published every day for twenty-four days.
    A set of Christmas-oriented challenges provide any input you have to use to answer using the language of your choice.
