Welcome to Advent of Code[^aoc]

This repository contains solutions to all 25 Days of Advent of Code 2021. Some have comments, some not. Most of the time I was trying to be as fast as possible so readability was not a goal here. More solutions than I would like to are pure bruteforce but since they worked I didn't feel the need to change them.


[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ an annual event in December since 2015.
