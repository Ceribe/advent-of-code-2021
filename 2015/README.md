# [Advent of Code 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015)

This is my second year of Advent of Code (did 2021 before) and I have to say this one was way easier.
20+ Days were easier than some 10- Days in 2021. This year I wrote way too many bruteforce solutions
and surprisingly most of them worked, so I had no need to upgrade them.

# How to run

After cloning enter "2015" directory and run "npm install".
Then you can run any of the "solution.js" using node. You can
either run it directly from terminal:

```bash
node /XX/solution.js
```

or using VSCode. In this case open "2015" directory with VSCode,
open the solution.js you want to run and press "Ctrl + F5".
