# [Advent of Code 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015)

This is my second year of Advent of Code (did 2021 before) and I have to say this one was way easier.
20+ Days were easier than some 10- Days in 2021. This year I wrote way too many bruteforce solutions
and surprisingly most of them worked, so I had no need to upgrade them.
