# [Advent of Code 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015)

This is my second year of Advent of Code (did 2021 before) and I have to say this one was way easier.
20+ Days (I'm looking at you day 20) were easier than some 10- Days in 2021. This year I wrote
way too many bruteforce solutions and surprisingly most of them worked, so I had no need to upgrade them.

## The Hardest One

### [Day 24: It Hangs in the Balance](https://github.com/ceribe/advent-of-code/tree/main/2015/src/24)

To be honest there was not almost no hard days. I chose day 24 as the hardest, because it was the only
one where I had to actually think about the problem for more than a few minutes. Had I not used brute
force so many times I would most likely found some other days challenging too.

## The Most Tedious One

Surprisingly none. All days were fast and easy.

## The Most Fun One

### [Day 22: Wizard Simulator 20XX](https://github.com/ceribe/advent-of-code/tree/main/2015/src/22)

This day was pretty amazing and I had a lot of fun solving it.

# How to run

## Preconditions

Steps below assume you are using a Linux distribution which has access to AUR. If you are
using a different distro then you are on your own.

- Install nodejs and npm

```bash
yay -S npm nodejs
```

- Optionally install VSCode

```bash
yay -S visual-studio-code-bin
```

- If you want to be able to edit the code and browse it easly install some JS extensions for VSCode.
  The ones I'm using are ESLint, Inline Parameters for VSCode, npm, npm Intellisense, Prettier - Code formatter.

## Run

After cloning enter "2015" directory and run "npm install".
Then you can run any of the "solution.js" using node. You can
either run it directly from terminal:

```bash
node /XX/solution.js
```

or using VSCode. In this case open "2015" directory with VSCode,
open the solution.js you want to run and press "Ctrl + F5".
