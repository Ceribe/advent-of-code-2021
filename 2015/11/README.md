This task was divided into two problems:
- Increasing password
- Checking if password is valid

First part I solved by converting password to an array of char codes which would
simulate a number.
Second part required to write 3 functions. Each one to check a different condition.
Combining both parts, solution is to increase the password until all the conditions are true.

Part 2 was trivial as it required to just run part 1 code twice.
